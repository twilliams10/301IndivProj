         <p>Twizzlers are a fun candy that seem like you can't just eat one and be satisfied. Twizzlers have a rival, the Red Vine, which I prefer but have a tough time finding Red Vines. Becuase of this difficulty, I choose Twizzlers as my favorite only because of the convenience of finding it. </p>
         <p>Twizzlers can be eaten in a variety of ways; you can bite each end and sip your favorite drink through the hollow middle for a touch of strawberry flavor. You can also have a Lady and the Tramp moment with a love interest by biting each end and meeting in the middle. Because Twizzlers are so long and flexible, be careful if you swing it around as it may hurt someone on the recieving end!</p>
