      The nav section (below) contains and unordered list <ul>.
      Each individual page is listed as a separate line item <li>.
      Note that the first two line items have been given a unique ID attribute value and an "href"
      which is a hypertext reference.  You will need to create two additional .htm files and references 
      for the other tabs to work.

        <br>
        <p>In these few articles, you will discover the few candies that are my favorites and absolute go-to's. Whether I'm stress eating or just want a sweet treat, I often find myself reaching for Sour Patch Watermelon, Twizzlers, and Dots. 
            </p>
        <p>Though they are all fruit flavored candies and often get stuck in people's teeth, it doesn't stop me from enjoying them on a fairly regular basis. I will also include other ways to enjoy these candies rather than just eating them plain.
            </p>

        <h2> Side Note on: Web security
          </h2>
        <p>
          Within the Navigator object (the child of the Window object of all the documents that have been opened during the current web browser session)
          one can get information about their current browser. Different browsers support different methoods and properties of this Navigation object
          that cannot be used with others. Different properties of the Navigator object can be seen below
        </p>
      
    <br>
  <table>
    <tr>
     <th>Properties</th>
     <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
     <td>appName</td>
     <td>Name of the web broswer displaying the page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
     <td>geoLocation</td>
     <td>API for accessing the user's current location and user permission settings denying or allowing access to that information</td>

      </tr>
  </table>
        <br>
    <p> With there being differences in the Navigator object, there are also differences within the Screen object, graphics, resolution, and color depth can vary dramatically. 
      Some screens may provide a vast space, sometimes making sizing challenging while others are very limiting with 
      limited resolution. The Screen object is used to obtain informaitonabout the dislay screen's size,
      resolution, and color depth. The table below illustrates the properties of the Screen object.
        </p>

     <th>Properties</th>
     <th>Description</th>
